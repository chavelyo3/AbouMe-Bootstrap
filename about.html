                  <p>Whether you’re here for my blog or to check out my work - I am happy you came! <br><br>
                    I have always enjoyed creating and styling from working on my MySpace page to helping my friends on launching and promoting their bussiness. I had originally went to school for criminal justice and took a gap year. During that time I had deceived that I wasn’t passionate about it. Took a long break and dedicated my time to customer service. Until I finally decided to enroll at the U of MN coding bootcamp. A huge career change but I have always loved working the front end of web development and now expanding my knowledge to take over front and back end of coding. This will also be where I’d be able to incorporate my many hobbies such as photography, graphic design, videographer, and content creator. <br>
                    
                    I have always been the type of person who enjoyed learning and honestly if I could have 50 + professions I would. Besides enjoy working with computers. I have a love for the ocean and warm weather. My ideal life would be traveling and just being outdoors. I also have a love for food and enjoy trying new restaurants. 
                    <br><br>
                    Now, thats enough about me. Explore my page and learn more about me and my skills as I explore coding and add it to my list of professions.
